This project involves developing a Python program that allows users to encrypt or decrypt a password using the Caesar cipher algorithm. 

The Caesar cipher is a simple and classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a specified number of places 
up or down the alphabet. Users can input their password and a shift value, which determines how the characters will be altered during the encryption or decryption process.
The program provides an easy way for users to securely encode their passwords or reveal previously encoded passwords. 
Non-alphabetic characters in the password, such as numbers and special symbols, remain unchanged during the process.

This project was developed and tested using PyCharm Community Edition 2023, ensuring compatibility and ease of execution in that development environment. 
It serves as an educational exercise in cryptography and demonstrates how basic encryption can be implemented in Python.


Understanding the Process:

Encryption Process:

For each letter in the plaintext:
Find its position in the alphabet (e.g., A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25).
Shift this position by the key value. If the end of the alphabet is reached, wrap around to the beginning (circular shift).
Replace the original letter with the letter at the new position.
Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) are usually not

Shift Value (Key): Choose a fixed number, 
called the "shift" or "key." This number determines how many positions each letter 
in the plaintext will be shifted. For example, if the shift is 3, then each letter 
in the message will be shifted three places forward in the alphabet.

Example:

Plaintext: "HELLO"
Shift: 3
Ciphertext: "KHOOR"

Here's how each letter is shifted:
H (7) → K (10)
E (4) → H (7)
L (11) → O (14)
L (11) → O (14)
O (14) → R (17)

Decryption Process:

To decrypt the message, shift the letters in the opposite direction by the same key value.
Using the previous example, "KHOOR" shifted backward by 3 positions results in "HELLO."

Limitations :
The Caesar cipher is extremely simple and can be easily broken, 
especially with modern computers. It's primarily useful for educational 
purposes and understanding the basics of cryptography.
